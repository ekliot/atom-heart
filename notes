2D action platformer inspired by bakugo from MHA

both combat and movement is primarily based around explosions from hands
mouse/right stick to aim hands
left/right click/bumper detonate separate hands, and can be charged
explosions deal damage in a short range cone, and push the player in an opposite direction
explosions either:
  recharge after trigger (variable based on charge amount)
  have a regenerating resource (e.g. stamina)
  
  this is to make infinitely flying very difficult (impossible?)

hold modifier buttons to change explosion type
  AP shot (beam attack)
